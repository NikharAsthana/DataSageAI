            "France France, X officially the French Republic, XI is a country located primarily in Western Europe. Its overseas regions and territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean, giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the northeast, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the southeast, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the northwest. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea. Its eighteen integral regions five of which are overseas span a combined area of 643,801 km2 248,573 sq mi and have a total population of nearly 68.4 million as of January 2024 update . France is a semi presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and economic centre. in Europe green dark grey in the European Union green Metropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Franks formed the kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid 14th to the mid 15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, French culture flourished during the French Renaissance and a French colonial empire emerged. Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV. The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien R gime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured the Bourbon Restoration until the founding of the French Second Republic which was succeeded by the Second French Empire upon Napoleon III's takeover. His empire collapsed during the Franco Prussian War in 1870. This led to the establishment of the Third French Republic, and subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle poque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allies of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France. France retains its centuries long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the fourth largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, having received 100 million foreign visitors in 2023. A developed country, France has a high nominal per capita income globally, and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world by both nominal GDP and PPP adjusted GDP. It is a great power, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the eurozone, as well as a member of the Group of Seven, NATO, OECD, and Francophonie. Contents Etymology Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name France comes from the Latin Francia, or 'realm of the Franks'. 13 The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank 'free' the latter stems from the Old French franc 'free, noble, sincere' , and ultimately from the Medieval Latin word francus 'free, exempt from service freeman, Frank\"', a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym Frank. 14 15 It has been suggested that the meaning 'free' was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation, 16 or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves. 15 The etymology of Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto Germanic word frank n, which translates as 'javelin' or 'lance' the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca , 17 although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around. 15 In English, 'France' is pronounced fr ns FRANSS in American English and fr ns FRAHNSS or fr ns FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with is mostly confined to accents with the trap bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English. 18 History Pre 6th century BC The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago. 19 Neanderthals occupied the region into the Upper Paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by Homo sapiens around 35,000 BC. 20 This period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the Dordogne and Pyrenees, including at Lascaux, dated to c. 18,000 BC. 19 At the end of the Last Glacial Period 10,000 BC , the climate became milder 19 from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary. After demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, metallurgy appeared, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron. 21 France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic, including the Carnac stones site approximately 3,300 BC . Antiquity 6th century BC 5th century AD In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia present day Marseille . 22 Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC. 23 Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Roman Italy, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome. 24 This left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a peace treaty. 25 But the Romans and the Gauls remained adversaries for centuries. 26 Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra \"Our Province\" , which evolved into Provence in French. 27 Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt by Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC. 28 Gaul was divided by Augustus into provinces 29 and many cities were founded during the Gallo Roman period, including Lugdunum present day Lyon , the capital of the Gauls. 29 In 250 290 AD, Roman Gaul suffered a crisis with its fortified borders attacked by barbarians. 30 The situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, a period of revival and prosperity. 31 In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Christians, who had been persecuted, increased. 32 But from the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed. 33 Teutonic tribes invaded the region, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks in the north. 34 Early Middle Ages 5th 10th century In Late antiquity, ancient Gaul was divided into Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo Roman territory. Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in west Armorica the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany and Celtic culture was revived. The first leader to unite all Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign as king of the Salian Franks in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors in 486. Clovis said he would be baptised a Christian in the event of victory against the Visigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths and was baptised in 508. Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" by the papacy, 35 and French kings called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\". The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was renamed Francia \"Land of the Franks\" . The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis Paris, Orl ans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household . One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours 732 . His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built an empire across Western and Central Europe. Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church, 36 Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I kept the empire united, however in 843, it was divided between Louis' three sons, into East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor. 37 During the 9th and 10th centuries, threatened by Viking invasions, France became a decentralised state the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and authority of the king became more religious than secular, and so was less effective and challenged by noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Some king's vassals grew so powerful they posed a threat to the king. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming vassal and the equal of the king of France, creating recurring tensions. High and Late Middle Ages 10th 15th century The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet was crowned king of the Franks. 38 His descendants unified the country through wars and inheritance. From 1190, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as \"kings of France\" rather than \"kings of the Franks\". 39 Later kings expanded their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern France by the 15th century. Royal authority became more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners. The nobility played a prominent role in Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up most reinforcements in the 200 years of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs referred to crusaders as Franj. 40 French Crusaders imported French into the Levant, making Old French the base of the lingua franca \"Frankish language\" of the Crusader states. 40 The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwest of modern day France. 41 From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, rulers of the County of Anjou, established its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then built an \"empire\" from England to the Pyrenees, covering half of modern France. Tensions between France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets. Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328. 42 The crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than Edward of Plantagenet, who became Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip, the monarchy reached the height of its medieval power. 42 However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward in 1337, and England and France entered the off and on Hundred Years' War. 43 Boundaries changed, but landholdings inside France by English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc, French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. France was struck by the Black Death, from which half of the 17 million population died. 44 Early modern period 15th century 1789 The French Renaissance saw cultural development and standardisation of French, which became the official language of France and Europe's aristocracy. France became rivals of the House of Habsburg during the Italian Wars, which would dictate much of their later foreign policy until the mid 18th century. French explorers claimed lands in the Americas, paving expansion of the French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion. 45 This forced Huguenots to flee to Protestant regions such as the British Isles and Switzerland. The wars were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, 46 assisted the Catholics from 1589 to 1594 and invaded France in 1597. Spain and France returned to all out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties. 47 Under Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu promoted centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power. He destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private armies. By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established \"the royal monopoly of force\". 48 France fought in the Thirty Years' War, supporting the Protestant side against the Habsburgs. From the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for about 10 of the transatlantic slave trade. 49 During Louis XIV's minority, trouble known as The Fronde occurred. This rebellion was driven by feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the royal absolute power. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and reign of Louis XIV, during which France further increased its influence. 50 By turning lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. The \"Sun King\" made France the leading European power. France became the most populous European country and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most used language in diplomacy, science, and literature until the 20th century. 51 France took control of territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the Code Noir providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jews from French colonies. 52 Under the wars of Louis XV r. 1715 1774 , France lost New France and most Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War 1756 1763 . Its European territory kept growing, however, with acquisitions such as Lorraine and Corsica. Louis XV's weak rule, including the decadence of his court, discredited the monarchy, which in part paved the way for the French Revolution. 53 Louis XVI r. 1774 1793 supported America with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge, but verged on bankruptcy a factor that contributed to the Revolution. Some of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and scientific breakthroughs, such as the naming of oxygen 1778 and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers 1783 , were achieved by French scientists. French explorers took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions. Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and was a factor in the Revolution. Revolutionary France 1789 1799 The French Revolution was a period of political and societal change that began with the Estates General of 1789, and ended with the coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799 and the formation of the French Consulate. Many of its ideas are fundamental principles of liberal democracy, 54 while its values and institutions remain central to modern political discourse. 55 Its causes were a combination of social, political and economic factors, which the Ancien R gime proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and social distress led in May 1789 to the convocation of the Estates General, which was converted into a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church in France, and a declaration of rights. The next three years were dominated by struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression. Military defeats following the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 resulted in the insurrection of 10 August 1792. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by the French First Republic in September, while Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. After another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended and power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety. About 16,000 people were executed in a Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Republic was replaced in 1795 by the Directory. Four years later in 1799, the Consulate seized power in a coup led by Napoleon. Napoleon and 19th century 1799 1914 Napoleon became First Consul in 1799 and later Emperor of the French Empire 1804 1814 1815 . Changing sets of European coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena Auerstadt and Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. 57 These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, Napoleonic Code and Declaration of the Rights of Man. In 1812 Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After this catastrophic campaign and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars. 57 After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy French troops began the conquest of Algeria. Unrest led to the French Revolution of 1848 and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and introduction of male universal suffrage was re enacted in 1848. In 1852, president of the French Republic, Louis Napol on Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, Mexico and Italy. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco Prussian War of 1870, and his regime replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence. 58 France had colonial possessions since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its empire extended greatly and became the second largest behind the British Empire. 59 Including metropolitan France, the total area reached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 9 of the world's land. Known as the Belle poque, the turn of the century was characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established. Early to mid 20th century 1914 1946 France was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain at the start of World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the north was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at tremendous human cost. It left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4 of its population. 60 61 Interwar was marked by intense international tensions and social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government e.g., annual leave, eight hour workdays, women in government . In 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern France and the French empire. The Vichy government, an authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government in exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London. 62 From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews, 63 were deported to death and concentration camps. 64 On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and in August they invaded Provence. The Allies and French Resistance emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the Provisional Government of the French Republic GPRF . This interim government, established by de Gaulle, continued to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It made important reforms e.g. suffrage extended to women and the creation of a social security system. 1946 present A new constitution resulted in the Fourth Republic 1946 1958 , which saw strong economic growth les Trente Glorieuses . France was a founding member of NATO and attempted to regain control of French Indochina, but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954. France faced another anti colonialist conflict in Algeria, then part of France and home to over one million European settlers Pied Noir . The French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control. 65 This conflict nearly led to a coup and civil war. 66 During the May 1958 crisis, the weak Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency. 67 The war concluded with the vian Accords in 1962 which led to Algerian independence, at a high price between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians. 68 Around one million Pied Noirs and Harkis fled from Algeria to France. 69 A vestige of empire is the French overseas departments and territories. During the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. He withdrew from NATO's military integrated command while remaining within the alliance , launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco German relations to create a European counterweight between American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring sovereign nations. The revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact it was a watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal religion, patriotism, respect for authority shifted to a more liberal moral ideal secularism, individualism, sexual revolution . Although the revolt was a political failure the Gaullist party emerged stronger than before it announced a split between the French and de Gaulle, who resigned. 70 In the post Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, establishing the eurozone in 1999 71 and signing the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007. 72 France has fully reintegrated into NATO and since participated in most NATO sponsored wars. 73 Since the 19th century, France has received many immigrants, often male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed. 74 During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants mostly from the Maghreb, in northwest Africa 74 to permanently settle in France with their families and acquire citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims living in subsidised public housing and suffering from high unemployment rates. 75 The government had a policy of assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French values and norms. 76 Since the 1995 public transport bombings, France has been targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people, 77 the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II 78 and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004. 79 Op ration Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015. 80 Geography Location and borders The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean Sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41 and 51 N, and longitudes 6 W and 10 E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west. Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres 212,935 sq mi , 81 the largest among European Union members. 71 France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories excluding Ad lie Land , is 643,801 km2 248,573 sq mi , 82 0.45 of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest. Due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second largest exclusive economic zone EEZ in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 4,261,000 sq mi . Its EEZ covers approximately 8 of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world. Geology, topography and hydrography Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. During the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine Basin in the southwest and the Paris Basin in the north. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rh ne Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres 15,782 ft 83 above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the France Italy border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60 of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks though moderate . The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the C te d'Alb tre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rh ne and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62 of the metropolitan territory. The Rh ne divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres 62 mi empties into the Atlantic Ocean. 84 Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11,000,000 km2 4,200,000 sq mi of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97 are overseas. Environment France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971. 85 France is ranked 19th by carbon dioxide emissions due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis, 86 which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production 87 and results in less pollution. 88 89 According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world. 90 91 Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 of 1990 levels by 2020. 92 As of 2009 update , French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China. 93 The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 94 however, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses. 95 Forests account for 31 per cent of France's land area the fourth highest proportion in Europe representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990. 96 97 98 French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees. 99 France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52 10, ranking it 123rd globally. 100 There are nine national parks 101 and 46 natural parks in France. 102 A regional nature park 103 French parc naturel r gional or PNR is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area. 104 105 As of 2019 update there are 54 PNRs in France. 106 Politics France is a representative democracy organised as a unitary semi presidential republic. 107 Democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics. 108 The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches. 109 It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature. 108 Government The executive branch has two leaders. The president, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five year term. 110 The prime minister, currently Fran ois Bayrou, is the head of government, appointed by the President to lead the government. The president has the power to dissolve Parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people the president also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, as well as serves as commander in chief of the Armed Forces. The prime minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters. 111 In the 2022 presidential election, Macron was re elected. 112 Two months later, in the June 2022 legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a minority government. 113 The legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body made up of a lower house, the National Assembly and an upper house, the Senate. 114 Legislators in the National Assembly, known as d put s, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five year terms. 115 The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years. 116 The Senate's legislative powers are limited in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say. 117 The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws. From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings one left wing, the French Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by the Socialist Party in 1969 and the other right wing, the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People 1947 , the Union of Democrats for the Republic 1958 , the Rally for the Republic 1976 , the Union for a Popular Movement 2007 and The Republicans since 2015 . In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, the radical centrist party La R publique En Marche! LREM became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far right party National Rally RN . Since 2020, Europe Ecology The Greens EELV have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities 118 while on a national level, an alliance of Left parties the NUPES was the second largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022. 119 Right wing populist RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022. 120 The electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits. 121 Administrative divisions France is divided into 18 regions located in Europe and overseas , five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France Clipperton. Since 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions 13 regions in metropolitan France including Corsica , 122 and five overseas. 81 The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments, 123 which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and R union are in overseas regions ROMs that are simultaneously overseas departments DOMs , enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union. The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons. 124 These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council. 124 Three communes Paris, Lyon and Marseille are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements. In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities French Polynesia, Saint Barth lemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna , one sui generis collectivity New Caledonia , one overseas territory French Southern and Antarctic Lands , and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean Clipperton Island . Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area except for Saint Barth lemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007 . The Pacific Collectivities COMs of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc 125 whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro. 126 Foreign relations France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights. 127 In 2015, it was described as \"the best networked state in the world\" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country 128 these include the G7, World Trade Organization WTO , 129 the Pacific Community SPC 130 and the Indian Ocean Commission COI . 131 It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States ACS 132 and a leading member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie OIF of 84 French speaking countries. 133 As a significant hub for international relations, France has the third largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF. 136 French foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU. 137 Since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO , but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009. 138 139 140 France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies Fran afrique 141 and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad. 142 From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of the Malian government in the Northern Mali conflict. In 2017, France was the world's fourth largest donor of development aid in absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. 143 This represents 0.43 of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD. 144 Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub Saharan Africa, 145 with an emphasis on \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\". 145 Military The French Armed Forces Forces arm es fran aises are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army Arm e de Terre , the French Navy Marine Nationale, formerly called Arm e de Mer , the French Air and Space Force Arm e de l'Air et de l'Espace , and the National Gendarmerie Gendarmerie nationale , which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2015 study by Cr dit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as the world's sixth most powerful military, and the second most powerful in Europe. 146 France's annual military expenditure in 2022 was US 53.6 billion, or 1.9 of its GDP, making it the eighth biggest military spender in the world. 147 There has been no national conscription since 1997. 148 France has been a recognised nuclear state since 1960. It is a party to both the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty CTBT 149 and the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force formerly known as \"Force de Frappe\" consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium range air to ground missiles with nuclear warheads 150 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super tendard Modernis SEM attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle R91 . France has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world. 151 The country has produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. France is a major arms seller, 152 153 with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear powered devices. One French intelligence unit, the Directorate General for External Security, is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Directorate General for Internal Security operates under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior. 154 France's cybersecurity capabilities are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world. 155 156 French weapons exported totaled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year 2021. Additionally, the UAE alone contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total. 157 Among the largest French defence companies are Dassault, Thales and Safran. 158 Law France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes 81 judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system . Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code which was largely based on the royal law codified under King Louis XIV . In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. French law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited . 159 While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la R publique fran aise. citation needed France does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws the latter in 1791 . However, \"offences against public decency\" contraires aux bonnes m urs or disturbing public order trouble l'ordre public have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. citation needed France generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBTQ rights. 160 Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal. 161 Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech. 162 France has laws against racism and antisemitism, 163 while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial. In 2024, France became the first nation in the European Union to explicitly protect abortion in its constitution. 164 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for la cit state secularism the state does not formally recognise any religion, except in Alsace Moselle, which continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face covering Islamic veils in public human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims. 165 166 However, it is supported by most of the population. 167 Economy France has a social market economy characterised by sizeable government involvement and diversified sectors. For roughly two centuries, the French economy has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally it is currently the world's ninth largest by purchasing power parity, the seventh largest by nominal GDP, and the second largest in the European Union by both metrics. 169 France is considered a great power with considerable economic strength, 170 being a member of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD , and the Group of Twenty largest economies. France's economy is highly diversified services represent two thirds of both the workforce and GDP, 171 while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent. 172 Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture 173 however, France's agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in overall production. 174 In 2018, France was the fifth largest trading nation in the world and the second largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP. 175 Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour. 176 Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy. 177 178 In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources. 179 According to the Bank of France founded in 1800 , 180 the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance. 181 The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in mainland Europe. 181 Under the doctrine of Dirigisme, the government historically played a major role in the economy policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as Trente Glorieuses. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one fifth of industrial employment and over four fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned state ownership now dominates only transportation, defence and broadcasting. 182 Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index, 183 and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report up two places from 2018 . 184 The Paris stock exchange French La Bourse de Paris is one of the oldest in the world, created in 1724. 185 In 2000, it merged with counterparts in Amsterdam and Brussels to form Euronext, 186 which in 2007 merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange. 186 Euronext Paris, the French branch of NYSE Euronext, is Europe's second largest stock exchange market. Some examples of the most valuable French companies include LVMH, L'Or al and Soci te G n rale. 187 France has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a \"global agricultural powerhouse\" France is the world's sixth biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over 7.4 billion. 188 189 Nicknamed \"the granary of the old continent\", 190 over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter. 191 Tourism With 100 million international tourist arrivals in 2023, 192 France is the world's top tourist destination, ahead of Spain 85 million and the United States 66 million . However, it ranks third in tourism derived income due to the shorter duration of visits. 193 The most popular tourist sites include annual visitors Eiffel Tower 6.2 million , Ch teau de Versailles 2.8 million , Mus um national d'Histoire naturelle 2 million , Pont du Gard 1.5 million , Arc de Triomphe 1.2 million , Mont Saint Michel 1 million , Sainte Chapelle 683,000 , Ch teau du Haut K nigsbourg 549,000 , Puy de D me 500,000 , Mus e Picasso 441,000 , and Carcassonne 362,000 . 194 France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world 7.7 million visitors in 2022 , the Mus e d'Orsay 3.3 million , mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Mus e de l'Orangerie 1.02 million , which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou 3 million , dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009. 195 With more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera French C te d'Azur , in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris Region. 196 With 6 million tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley French ch teaux and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France. 197 198 France has 52 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity green tourism . Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France literally \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\" . The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes Pyr n es that hosts several million visitors a year. Energy France is the world's tenth largest producer of electricity. 199 lectricit de France EDF , which is majority owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity, and one of the world's largest electric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally. 200 In 2018, EDF produced roughly one fifth of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power. 201 As of 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the U.K. and Italy, 202 and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world. 202 Since the 1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy of energy security, 202 namely through heavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries with nuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by the number of operational nuclear reactors, at 56. 203 Consequently, 70 of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin 204 only Slovakia and Ukraine also derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53 and 51 , respectively. 205 France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports. 202 France's significant reliance on nuclear power has resulted in comparatively slower adoption of renewable energy relative to other Western nations. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, France's production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled. 206 Hydropower is by far the leading source, accounting for over half the country's renewable energy sources 207 and contributing 13 of its electricity, 206 the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey. 207 As with nuclear power, most hydroelectric plants, such as Eguzon, tang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF. 207 France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040. 206 Transport France's railway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres 18,314 mi as of 2008, 209 is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany. 210 It is operated by the SNCF, and high speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km h 199 mph . 211 The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground or tramway services complementing bus services. There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres 638,262 mi of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent. 212 The Paris Region is enveloped with the densest network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citro n. 213 France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge, 214 and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and petrol driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 215 216 There are 464 airports in France. 81 Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille, 217 which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea. 218 12,261 kilometres 7,619 mi of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river. 81 Science and technology Since the Middle Ages, France has contributed to scientific and technological achievement. In the early 11th century, the French born Pope Sylvester II reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to much of Europe. 220 The University of Paris, founded in the mid 12th century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the Western world. 221 In the 17th century, mathematician and philosopher Ren Descartes pioneered rationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics both were key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The French Academy of Sciences, founded in the mid 17th century by Louis XIV to encourage and protect French scientific research, was one of the earliest national scientific institutions in history. The Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon, one of the first naturalists to recognize ecological succession, and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion. Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclop die, which aimed to give the public access to \"useful knowledge\" that could be applied to everyday life. 222 The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France, with Augustin Fresnel founding modern optics, Sadi Carnot laying the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur pioneering microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the period have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincar physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity physicist Paul Langevin and virologist Luc Montagnier, co discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed in Lyon in 1998 by an international team that included Jean Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant. 223 Telesurgery was first performed by French surgeons led by Jacques Marescaux on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean. 224 A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle. 225 226 France ranked 12th in the 2024 Global Innovation Index, compared to 16th in 2019. 227 228 Demographics With an estimated population of 68,373,433 people, 8 XII France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third most populous in Europe after Russia and Germany , and the second most populous in the European Union after Germany . For much of the 21st century, France has been an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth by birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006. 229 Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth. 230 This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. Since 2011, France's fertility rate has been steadily declining 231 it stood at 1.79 per woman in 2023, 232 below the replacement rate of 2.1 and well below the high of 4.41 in 1800. 233 234 235 France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain the highest in the EU 236 and among the highest in Europe overall, where the average is 1.5. 237 The mean age of French women at the birth of their first child was 29.1, which is slightly younger than the EU average of 29.7. 236 Like many developed nations, the French population is aging The average age is 41.7 years, while roughly one fifth of French people are 65 or over. 238 It is projected that one in three French will be over 60 by 2024. Life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world additionally, French Polynesia and the French region of R union ranked fourth and 11th in life expectancy, at 84.07 years and 83.55, respectively. From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year 239 since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually, 240 and France is projected to continue growing until 2044. 241 Immigrants are major contributors to this trend in 2010, roughly one in four newborns 27 percent in metropolitan France had at least one foreign born parent and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe excluding French overseas territories . 242 In 2021, the share of children of foreign born mothers was 23 percent. 236 Major cities France is a highly urbanised country, with its largest cities in terms of metropolitan area population in 2021 243 being Paris 13,171,056 inh. , Lyon 2,308,818 , Marseille 1,888,788 , Lille 1,521,660 , Toulouse 1,490,640 , Bordeaux 1,393,764 , Nantes 1,031,953 , Strasbourg 864,993 , Montpellier 823,120 , and Rennes 771,320 . Note since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders, INSEE considers that Nice is a metropolitan area separate from the Cannes Antibes metropolitan area these two combined would have a population of 1,019,905, as of the 2021 census . Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century. Ethnic groups Historically, French people were mainly of Celtic Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic Romans and Germanic Franks groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement. 244 Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast. Large scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society beginning with the French Revolution and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White 85 of the population , 6 million were Northwest African 10 , 2 million were Black 3.3 , and 1 million were Asian 1.7 . 245 246 A 2008 poll conducted jointly by the nstitut national d' tudes d mographiques and the French National Institute of Statistics 247 248 estimated that the largest minority ancestry groups were Italian 5 million , followed by Northwest African 3 6 million , 249 250 251 Sub Saharan African 2.5 million , Armenian 500,000 , and Turkish 200,000 . 252 There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek. 249 253 254 France has a significant Gitan Romani population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000 255 many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently. 256 Immigration It is currently estimated that 40 of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century 257 between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France. 258 The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco. 259 260 They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal. France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually. 261 In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications albeit a 15 decrease from 2004 . 262 In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world. 263 In subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017. 264 The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration. citation needed Foreigners' rights are established in the Code of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right to Asylum. Immigration remains a contentious political issue. 265 In 2008, the INSEE National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies estimated that the total number of foreign born immigrants was around 5 million 8 of the population , while their French born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11 of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry. 266 267 268 In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey. 269 In 2022, more than 320,000 migrants came to France, with the majority coming from Africa. 270 In 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the institute, this increase resulted from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period. 271 Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000. 271 Of the total of 229,000 foreigners coming to France in 2012, nearly 8 were Portuguese, 5 British, 5 Spanish, 4 Italian, 4 German, 3 Romanian, and 3 Belgian. 271 Language The official language of France is French, 272 a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Acad mie fran aise has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish Dutch dialect , Alsatian German dialect , Basque, and Corsican Italian dialect . Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859. 273 The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. It is estimated that between 300 million 274 and 500 million 275 people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or as a second language. According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2 of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic 3.6 , 2.3 million , Portuguese 1.5 , 960,000 , Spanish 1.2 , 770,000 and Italian 1.0 , 640,000 . Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2 of the population. 276 Religion France is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. The French policy on religion is based on the concept of la cit , a strict separation of church and state under which the government and public life are kept completely secular, detached from any religion. The region of Alsace and Moselle is an exception to the general French norm since the local law stipulates official status and state funding for Lutheranism, Catholicism, and Judaism. 277 Catholicism has been the main religion in France for more than a millennium, and it was once the country's state religion. 278 France was traditionally considered the Church's eldest daughter French Fille a n e de l' glise , and the King of France always maintained close links to the Pope, 279 receiving the title Most Christian Majesty from the Pope in 1464. 280 However, the French monarchy maintained a significant degree of autonomy, namely through its policy of \"Gallicanism\", whereby the king selected bishops rather than the papacy. 281 Its role nowadays, however, has been greatly reduced, although, as of 2012, among the 47,000 religious buildings in France 94 were still Catholic churches. 282 After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the aforementioned principle of la cit . 283 The government is prohibited from recognising specific rights to any religious community with the exception of legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the aforementioned local law in Alsace Moselle . It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine, and religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking. 284 Some religious groups, such as Scientology, the Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple, are considered cults sectes in French, which is considered a pejorative term 285 in France, and therefore they are not granted the same status as recognised religions. 286 Health The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world. 288 The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997. 289 290 In 2011, France spent 11.6 of its GDP on health care, or US 4,086 per capita, 291 a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe. Approximately 77 of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies. 292 Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases affections de longues dur es such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women. 293 294 There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France, 295 and average health care spending per capita was US 4,719 in 2008. 296 As of 2007 update , approximately 140,000 inhabitants 0.4 of France are living with HIV AIDS. 81 Education In 1802, Napoleon created the lyc e, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession. 298 Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education currently mandatory until the age of 16 . 299 300 French education is centralised and divided into three stages primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018. 301 302 France was one of the PISA participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers. 302 Schoolchildren in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries. 302 Higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes coles, such as Sciences Po Paris for political studies, HEC Paris for economics, Polytechnique, the cole des hautes tudes en sciences sociales for social studies and the cole nationale sup rieure des mines de Paris that produce high profile engineers, or the cole nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes coles have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians. 303 Culture Art The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the court endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, Fran ois Boucher and Jean Honor Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques Louis David and the highly influential Acad mie des Beaux Arts defined the style known as Academism. In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, douard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir. 304 The second generation of impressionist style painters, Paul C zanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant garde of artistic evolutions, 305 as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, Andr Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck. 306 307 At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky. There are many art museums in France, the most famous of which being the state owned Mus e du Louvre, which collects artwork from the 18th century and earlier. The Mus e d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements . 308 309 It was voted the best museum in the world in 2018. 310 Modern works are presented in the Mus e National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state owned museums are visited by close to 17 million people a year. 311 Architecture During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Ch teau d'Angers, the massive Ch teau de Vincennes and the so called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning \"French work\", 312 was born in le de France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe. 313 Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica used as the royal necropolis other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre Dame de Chartres and Notre Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church Notre Dame de Reims. 314 The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Ch teau de Montsoreau. 315 Examples of such residential castles include the Ch teau de Chambord, the Ch teau de Chenonceau, or the Ch teau d'Amboise. Following the Renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, Baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one. 316 In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many Baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the Baroque era he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides. 317 Some of the most impressive provincial Baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey. 318 319 After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture. 320 Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth extravagant buildings such as the neo Baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous most notably, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France the associated architect was Eug ne Viollet le Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower. In the 20th century, French Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres 121 ft . 321 France's largest financial district is La D fense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. 322 Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu. Literature and philosophy The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot Grail are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are Chr tien de Troyes, Christine de Pizan langue d'o l , and Duke William IX of Aquitaine langue d'oc . Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the Carolingian cycle, such as the Song of Roland and the chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard 'the Fox' and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th century writer was Fran ois Rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with Marguerite de Navarre, author of the Heptameron. 323 Another 16th century author was Michel de Montaigne, whose most famous work, Essais, started a literary genre. 324 French literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot is best known as the main editor of the Encyclop die, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and St phane Mallarm . 325 The 19th century saw the writings of many French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all time\" 326 for excelling in all literary genres. Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. 327 His novel Les Mis rables is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written 328 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo , Jules Verne Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas , mile Zola Les Rougon Macquart , Honor de Balzac La Com die humaine , Guy de Maupassant, Th ophile Gautier and Stendhal The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma , whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. In the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom. 329 Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries. 329 The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare. 329 Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis Ferdinand C line, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exup ry wrote The Little Prince, which is one of the best selling books in history. 330 331 Medieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of Ren Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors. 332 333 France in the 18th century saw major philosophical contributions from Voltaire who came to embody the Enlightenment and Jean Jacques Rousseau whose work highly influenced the French Revolution. 334 335 French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre. 336 Other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works of Simone Weil, contributions to structuralism including from Claude L vi Strauss and the post structuralist works by Michel Foucault. 337 338 Music France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed talented musicians and composers in the royal court. Composers of this period include Marc Antoine Charpentier, Fran ois Couperin, Michel Richard Delalande, Jean Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean Philippe Rameau reached some prestige. citation needed Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord. 339 In the field of classical music, France has produced a number of notable composers such as Gabriel Faur , Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Hector Berlioz. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. The two composers invented new musical forms 340 341 342 343 and new sounds. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed. 344 His music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. Erik Satie was a key member of the early 20th century Parisian avant garde. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perp tuels 1919 , the ballet Les biches 1923 , the Concert champ tre 1928 for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carm lites 1957 and the Gloria 1959 for soprano, choir and orchestra. In the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music. 345 French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson fran aise, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, L o Ferr , Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg. 346 Modern pop music has seen the rise of popular French hip hop, French rock, techno funk, and turntablists DJs. Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English speaking countries, 347 bands such as Noir D sir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira, 348 or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Cinema France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumi re known as the Lumi re Brothers credited with creating cinema in 1895. 352 The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy Blach , was also from France. 353 Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the government. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015 update producing more films than any other European country. 354 355 The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world. 356 357 Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kie lowski, Andrzej u awski , Argentina Gaspar No , Edgardo Cozarinsky , Russia Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak , Austria Michael Haneke and Georgia G la Babluani, Otar Iosseliani are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50 , compared with 77 in Germany and 69 in Japan. 358 French films account for 35 of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14 in Spain and 8 in the UK. 358 In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States. 359 As part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products, 360 France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993. 361 Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005 the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it. 362 Fashion Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards. The association of France with fashion and style French la mode dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV 363 when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion French couture or haute couture industry in the years 1860 1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town of Grasse. 364 According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey LVMH , a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor. 365 Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales LVMH, Kering SA, L'Or al , more than any other country in the world. 365 Media In 2021, regional daily newspapers, such as Ouest France, Sud Ouest, La Voix du Nord, Dauphin Lib r , Le T l gramme, and Le Progr s, more than doubled the sales of national newspapers, such as Le Monde, Le Figaro, L' quipe sports , Le Parisien, and Les Echos finance . Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centers, continue to increase their market share. 367 The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country. 368 The most influential news magazines are the left wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right wing Le Point in 2009 more than 400,000 copies , 369 but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Encha n and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent, 370 371 but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies. 372 In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already existing TV channels and four national radio stations 373 374 remained under state control.

History Name The name \"France\" comes from the Latin word Francia ', which means \"land of the Franks\". 18 Roman Gaul The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient Gaul. Celtic Gauls inhabited Ancient Gaul. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul for Rome in the 1st century BC. 19 Eventually, the Gauls adopted Roman speech Latin, from which the French language evolved and Roman culture. Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries. Franks In the 4th century AD, the Germanic tribes, principally the Franks invaded the Gauls. This is how the name Francie appeared. The modern name \"France\" comes from the name of the Capetian Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Christianity rather than Arianism. The French called themselves \"the most Christian Kingdom of France\". 20 The Treaty of Verdun 843 , divided Charlemagne's Empire into three parts. 21 The biggest area was Western Francia. It is similar to modern France. Kingdom Middle Ages The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet became King of France. His descendants, the Direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon, unified the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance. Enlightenment The monarchy was the most powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV of France. 22 At that time, France had the largest population in Europe. The country had a big influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the common language of diplomacy in international affairs. Much of the Enlightenment happened in France. French scientists made big scientific discoveries in the 18th century. France also conquered many overseas possessions in the Americas and Asia. 23 Republic Napoleonic Wars France had a monarchy until the French Revolution in 1789. King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, were executed in 1793. 24 Thousands of other French citizens were killed. Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the Republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire 1804 1814 . His armies conquered most of continental Europe. 25 The metric system was invented by French scientists during the French revolution. That time 3 estates were developed. After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, another monarchy arose. An interesting fact is that the French King Louis XIX was king for only 20 minutes from the time his father Charles X abdicated, to the time the July Monarchy started in 1830. Later Louis Napol on Bonaparte created the Second Empire in 1852. Louis Napol on was removed after the defeat in the Franco Prussian war of 1870. The Third Republic replaced his regime. 26 Colonialism The large French colonial empire in the 19th century included parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia. The culture and politics of these regions were influenced by France. Many ex colonies officially speak the French language. 27 World Wars The country actively took part in both the First and Second World Wars, with battles taking place on its soil. During the First World War, millions were killed in the trenches including over a million in the Battle of the Somme. 28 The conditions were extremely difficult for the soldiers on the front. The last surviving veteran was Pierre Picault who died on 20 November 2008 at the age of 109. 29 During the Second World War, Nazis occupied France.

For instance it has supplied economic aid and troops for peace keeping missions in the Ivory Coast and Chad. Economy France is a member of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries. France has the eighth largest economy in the world by Gross domestic product GDP which takes into account how much it costs to live in different countries and inflation rates . 41 France and 11 other European Union members jointly launched the euro on 1 January 1999 and started using it in 2002. 42 France's economy has nearly 2.9 million registered companies. 43 The government has a considerable influence over railway, electricity, aircraft, and telecommunications firms as it owns big companies like SNCF and EDF French electricity . 44 France has an important aerospace design of aircraft and spacecraft industry led by Airbus. 45 It can also launch rockets from French Guiana. 46 France has invested a lot in nuclear power. This made France the smallest producer of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialised countries in the world. 47 As a result, 59 nuclear power plants generate most of the electricity produced in the country 78 in 2006, 48 up from only 8 in 1973, 24 in 1980, and 75 in 1990 . France is the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe. 49 France exports wheat, poultry, dairy products, beef, and pork. It is also famous for its wine industry.

France will host the Summer Olympics in 2024, in Paris. France also hosted the Winter Games three times in 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble, and in 1992 in Albertville. Cuisine French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world. 66 The roots of modern haute cuisine lie in chefs like La Varenne 1615 1678 and the notable chef of Napoleon, Marie Antoine Car me 1784 1833 . These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the Middle Ages. They used fewer spices, and more herbs and creamy ingredients. Typical ingredients like roux and fish stock, and techniques such as marinading, and dishes such as ragout, were invented. Car me was an expert p tissier pastry maker , and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces' he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half dozen mother sauces. French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier 1846 1935 . He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace how the staff should be organised how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London, the H tel Ritz Paris, and some of the greatest cruise ships. Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France. Gastro tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to make people familiar with the rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have become common all over the country. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally. 67 68 69 In the north of France, people often prefer to use butter to cook. In the south, they prefer olive oil and garlic. 70 In France, each region has its own special dish choucroute in Alsace, quiche in Lorraine, cassoulet in the Languedoc Roussillon, and tapenade in Provence Alpes C te d'Azur. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by UNESCO to its lists of the world's 'intangible cultural heritage'. 71 72 Tourism France is the number one tourist destination in the world. In 2007, 81.9 million foreign tourists visited France. 73 Spain comes second 58.5 million in 2006 and the United States comes third 51.1 million in 2006 . Some of the most famous attractions in Paris, are the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. Another one is Mont Saint Michel, in Normandy. 74 A European Disneyland is located in a suburb east of Paris. The resort opened in 1992 and is also a popular tourist destination in Europe.

A possib More We report on the intriguing properties of a variable X ray source projected at the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy NGC 6099 d approx 139 Mpc . If truly located near NGC 6099, this is a hyperluminous X ray source that reached an X ray luminosity L X approx a few times 10 42 erg s 1 in 2012 February XMM Newton data , about 50 to 100 times brighter than in 2009 May Chandra and 2023 August XMM Newton . The X ray spectrum was soft at all three epochs, with a thermal component at kT approx 0.2 keV and a power law photon index 3 . Such properties make it a strong candidate for an intermediate mass black hole IMBH . We also discovered a point like, blue optical counterpart m g, Vega approx24.7 mag, M g, Vega approx 11.2 mag , from images taken by the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, and later confirmed with Hubble Space Telescope observations. The optical continuum can be modeled as stellar emission from a compact star cluster or an X ray irradiated accretion disk, consistent with the IMBH scenario. We discuss alternative explanations for the nature of this system. A possible scenario is tidal stripping of an orbiting star, with repeated X ray outbursts every few years. An alternative possibility is that the thermal X ray emission seen in 2009 was from shocked gas in the self intersecting tidal stream during the rising phase of a tidal disruption event, while the 2012 and 2023 emissions were from the fully formed accretion disk.

Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one class few shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state of the art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self context used in our approach. Less Submitted 1 March, 2025 originally announced March 2025. Comments Copyright 2022 IEEE.

In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to estimate it. It takes into account both the insertion of fines into the granular skeleton of the sand when the size ratio allows it, and the way in which the particles are assembled.

In doing so, we use the instantaneous Stokes parameters to incorporate the polarization state of the signal. While the first formulation exploits the statistics of the Stokes representation in a Bayesian setting, the second uses a kernel regression formulation to impose locally smooth time varying polarization properties. In turn, we obtain two formulations that allow us to use both signal and polarization domain regularization for denoising a bivariate signal. The solutions to them exploit the polarization information efficiently as demonstrated in the numerical simulations Less Submitted 28 February, 2025 originally announced February 2025.

In this paper, we give a complete geometric proof of a recursive formula, which reduces the calculation of the intersection Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of semistable bundles on Riemann surfaces in degree 0 and arbitrary rank to the known formulas of the Betti numbers of the smooth, degree 1 moduli spaces. Our formula was motivated by the work of Mozgovoy and Reineke in 2015, and appears as a consequence of the Decomposition Theorem applied to the forgetful map from a parabolic moduli space. Our methods are direct, geometric and use a minimal amount of background. Less Submitted 27 February, 2025 originally announced February 2025.

Mandal, P. Duffell, L. Drissen, Z. Ding Abstract We present extensive proper motion measurements of the Crab Nebula made from Canada France Hawaii Telescope MegaPrime MegaCam images taken in 2007, 2016, and 2019. A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty 16 mag . Spectroscopic follow up observations of these candidates were conducted using the 2SPOT facilities in Chile and France, as well as 1 m C2PU's Epsilon telescope at the Calern Observatory. This paper focuses on the brighter sample. Among the 37 targets, we confirmed 17 and 16 new Galactic WC and WN type WR stars, respectively. Three of them were recently reported as new WR stars in an independent study. The Gaia mission provides a valuable resource for uncovering WR stars missed in earlier surveys. While this work concentrated on a relatively small starting sample provided by the ESP ELS algorithm, our findings highlight the potential for refining selection criteria to identify additional candidates not included in the outputs of the algorithm. Furthermore, the observation program underscores the utility of small telescopes in acquiring initial spectral data for sources with magnitudes up to G sim 16 mag.

Excited nitrogen is produced using nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges. The applied voltage and the repetition frequencies are adjusted to minimize rotational and gas heating while keeping high electronic and vibrational excitation levels. The populations of the vibrational levels are measured using optical emission spectroscopy of the N 2 C to B, 0 vibrational bands. Rate coefficients for each vibrational level are then determined from the measured lifetimes.

Leveraging improvements to the textit HST COS wavelength solution, we co add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions textit v' , textit J' 1,4 , 1,7 , 0,2 , and 3,16 to improve signal to noise, and we fit each co added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S N line profiles S N geq 12 at the peak of the profile , over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the 1,4 and 1,7 progressions, we find a systematic blue shift of a few km s 1 between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the 0,2 progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of 5 km s 1 for the single and narrow components, and 10 km s 1 for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low velocity systematic blue shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical O I surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H 2 mass loss rates of 10 9 to 10 11 M odot yr 1 , but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.

In the initial stage, NarrativeGuide constructs a knowledge graph for attractions within a city, then configures the worldview, character setting, and exposition based on the knowledge graph. Using this foundation, the knowledge graph is combined to generate an independent scene unit for each attraction. During the itinerary planning stage, NarrativeGuide models narrative driven travel planning as an optimization problem, utilizing a genetic algorithm GA to refine the itinerary. Before evaluating the candidate itinerary, transition scripts are generated for each pair of adjacent attractions, which, along with the scene units, form a complete script. The weighted sum of script coherence, travel time, and attraction scores is then used as the fitness value to update the candidate solution set. Experimental results across four cities, i.e., Nanjing and Yangzhou in China, Paris in France, and Berlin in Germany, demonstrate significant improvements in narrative coherence and cultural fit, alongside a notable reduction in travel time and an increase in the quality of visited attractions. Our study highlights that incorporating external evolutionary optimization effectively addresses the limitations of large language models in travel planning.

The ESA Concurrent Engineering Challange 2024 was hosted by four Concurrent Design Facilites CDF across Europe ESEC Galazia, ISAE SUPAERO, the University of Athens, and the University of Portsmouth. A total of 102 students participated in the event. Over five days, students worked on a feasibility study for a space mission, simulating ESA's design session at ESTEC, the ESA headquarters. Students were divided into specializes groups based on their backgrounds, reflecting ESA's concurrent engineering teams. This paper discusses the design of subsystems by students, their trade off results, and the outcomes of the CDF study. It highlights the effectiveness of concurrent engineering, which enabled rapid and efficient results even from non esxpert teams. The future development roadmap and lessons learned are also presented. The students used CDP4 Comet software within the replicated ESA CDF, resulting in the PEDRO V mission proposal Planetary Exploration Deployment and Research Operation Venus. The teams collaboratively defined the Concept of Operations, identified actors, worst case scenarios, use cases, and activities. Their output included a list of requirements, a draft product breakdown structure, and key subsystems information. The concurrent engineering process led to continuous improvement and convergence of key parameters. This approach proved to be effective by aligning different teams' solutions and comparing them to similar missions. The PEDRO V mission feasibility was confirmed, demonstrating the potential of concurrent engineering in accademic settings for space missions. summarized with AI Less Submitted 19 February, 2025 originally announced February 2025.

Historically, technological innovations have been governed by concentrated expertise with limited public input. However, AI's pervasive influence across domains such as healthcare, employment, and justice necessitates inclusive governance approaches. This article explores the tension between expert led oversight and democratic participation, analyzing models of participatory and deliberative democracy. Using case studies from France and Brazil, we highlight how inclusive frameworks can bridge the gap between technical complexity and public accountability. Recommendations are provided for integrating these approaches into a balanced governance model tailored to the European Union, emphasizing transparency, diversity, and adaptive regulation to ensure that AI governance reflects societal values while maintaining technical rigor.

We introduce the model, detail its implementation and experiment it through numerical results using datasets collected in Grenoble France . More Air quality monitoring requires to produce accurate estimation of nitrogen dioxide or fine particulate matter concentration maps, at different moments. A typical strategy is to combine different types of data. On the one hand, concentration maps produced by deterministic physicochemical models at urban scale, and on the other hand, concentration measures made at different points, different moments, and by different devices. These measures are provided first by a small number of reference stations, which give reliable measurements of the concentration, and second by a larger number of micro sensors, which give biased and noisier measurements. The proposed approach consists in modeling the bias of the physicochemical model and estimating the parameters of this bias using all the available concentration measures. Our model relies on a partition of the geographical space of interest into different zones within which the bias is assumed to be modeled by a single affine transformation of the actual concentration. Our approach allows to improve the concentration maps provided by the deterministic models but also to understand the behavior of micro sensors and their contribution in improving air quality monitoring.

Traditional pruning approaches, while effective in model size reduction, necessitate additional peripheral circuitry to manage complex dataflows and mitigate dislocation issues, leading to increased area and energy overheads. To circumvent these drawbacks, we propose leveraging low rank compression techniques, which, unlike pruning, streamline the dataflow and seamlessly integrate with IMC architectures. However, low rank compression presents its own set of challenges, namely i suboptimal IMC array utilization and ii compromised accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach i employing shift and duplicate kernel SDK mapping technique, which exploits idle IMC columns for parallel processing, and ii group low rank convolution, which mitigates the information imbalance in the decomposed matrices. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 2.5x speedup or 20.9 accuracy boost over existing pruning techniques.

This paper argues that while ABMs prioritize scientific analysis and understanding and VR aims for immersive entertainment, they both simulate artificial worlds and can benefit from closer integration. Coupling both approaches indeed opens interesting possibilities for research and development in various fields, and in particular education, at the heart of the SIMPLE project, an EU funded project on the development of digital tools for awareness raising on environmental issues. However, existing tools often present limitations, including technical complexity, limited functionalities, and lack of interoperability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for linking GAMA, a popular ABM platform, with Unity, a widely used game engine. This framework enables seamless data exchange, real time visualization, and user interaction within VR environments, allowing researchers to leverage the strengths of both ABMs and VR for more impactful and engaging simulations. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through two prototypes built to highlight its potential in representing and interacting with complex socio environmental system models. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration between the ABM and VR communities to develop robust, user friendly tools, paving the way for a new era of collaborative research and immersive experiences in simulations.

This study empirically investigates the role of financialization in global food markets and its policy implications for a stable and secure food system. Using panel data regression models, moderating effects models, and panel regression with a threshold variable, we analyze wheat, maize, and soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. We incorporate data on annual trading volume, open interest contracts, and their ratio. The sample consists of five developed countries United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and seven developing countries China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand , covering the period 2000 to 2021. The Human Development Index HDI serves as a threshold variable to differentiate the impact across countries. Our findings indicate that the financialization of agricultural commodities has negatively affected global food security, with wheat and soybean showing a greater adverse impact than maize. The effects are more pronounced in developing countries. Additionally, we find that monetary policy has the potential to mitigate these negative effects. These results provide insights for policymakers to design strategies that ensure a secure and accessible global food supply. Less Submitted 8 February, 2025 originally announced February 2025.

Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary formation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have pointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the importance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role of interactions between the intercluster medium ICM and the cool gas in the filaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source, 3C84, and the filaments. In this paper, we present multi filter observations of the entire filamentary system that cover the optical bandpass, using the SITELLE instrument at the Canada France Hawai'i Telescope. Here, we use the data analysis software, href to produce flux maps of the prominent emission lines present in the filters oii 3726 3729, oiii 5007, H , nii 6548, nii 6583, and H . We use these maps to produce BPT and WHAN diagrams to study the ionization mechanisms at play in each distinct region of the filamentary nebula. First, we confirm the absence of oiii 5007 in the extended filaments, although we detect this line in the central core, revealing a compact region where photoionization by the AGN might affect local conditions. Our findings corroborate previous claims that the ionization in the extended filaments could be caused by the cooling ICM via collisional excitation and or mixing. Moreover, they support the conclusion that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation and continued existence of the filaments.

This paper builds upon our previous work 16 , which evaluated various models using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, triple matching, and graph matching, and introduces a refined approach to address the critical issues of hallucination and omission. We propose an enhanced evaluation framework incorporating BERTScore for graph similarity, setting a practical threshold of 95 for graph matching. Our experiments focus on the Mistral model, comparing its original and fine tuned versions in zero shot and few shot settings. We further extend our experiments using examples from the KELM sub training dataset, illustrating that the fine tuned model significantly improves knowledge graph construction accuracy while reducing the exact hallucination and omission. However, our findings also reveal that the fine tuned models perform worse in generalization tasks on the KELM sub dataset.

This paper uncovers the phenomenon of linear correlations in LMs during knowledge composition. For explanation, there exists a linear transformation between certain related knowledge that maps the next token prediction logits from one prompt to another, e.g., \"X lives in the city of\" rightarrow \"X lives in the country of\" for every given X. This mirrors the linearity in human knowledge composition, such as Paris rightarrow France. Our findings indicate that the linear transformation is resilient to large scale fine tuning, generalizing updated knowledge when aligned with real world relationships, but causing hallucinations when it deviates. Empirical results suggest that linear correlation can serve as a potential identifier of LM's generalization. Finally, we show such linear correlations can be learned with a single feedforward network and pre trained vocabulary representations, indicating LM generalization heavily relies on the latter.

More This study represents a first attempt to build a backcasting methodology to identify the optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. In this methodology, desired objectives are set by decision makers at a given time horizon, and then the optimal combinations of policies to achieve these objectives are computed as a function of time i.e., backcasted'' . This approach is illustrated on the transportation sector by considering a specific subsystem with a single policy decision. The subsystem describes the evolution of the passenger car fleet within a given region and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The optimized policy is a monetary incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles while minimizing the total budget of the state and achieving a desired CO 2 target.

Whether the study concerns mooring systems pinned both at seabed and floating platform, cables towed by a moving underwater system or when special links such as stiffeners are needed, the ability to model every combination is a key point. To do so the authors propose to investigate the use of the shooting method to solve the two point boundary value problem TPBVP associated with Dirichlet, Robin or mixed boundary conditions representing respectively, displacement, force and force displacement boundary conditions. 3D nonlinear static string calculations are confronted to a semi analytic formulation established from the catenary closed form equations. The comparisons are performed on various pairs of boundary conditions developed in five configurations. Less Submitted 12 December, 2024 originally announced February 2025.

A case study applied to Metropolitan France is presented to illustrate the approach. Additionally, alternative policy scenarios are also analyzed. More This study represents a first attempt to build a backcasting methodology to identify the optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. Specifically, it considers a passenger car fleet subsystem, modelling its evolution and greenhouse gas emissions. The policy decision under consideration is the monetary incentive to the purchase of electric vehicles. This process is cast as an optimal control problem with the objective to minimize the total budget of the state and reach a desired CO 2 target. A case study applied to Metropolitan France is presented to illustrate the approach. Additionally, alternative policy scenarios are also analyzed.

Energy noise indicators used to characterize population exposure do not adequately reflect the repetitive nature of railway noise peaks. The GENIFER pilot study aims to test a protocol designed to characterize railway noise events according to the instantaneous perceived annoyance when the train is passing, in order to improve understanding of the influence of acoustic factors on annoyance. The first phase of the survey was carried out in 2023 among 62 residents of a pilot site. An electronic device was used to collect around 5,000 ratings, ranging from 1 to 10, assessing the instantaneous annoyance induced by railway noise at passing trains. The site instrumentation included sixteen sound level meters and two video recording systems, enabling annoyance ratings to be associated with the acoustic characteristics of railway noise events. A questionnaire aimed at identifying co determinants of long term annoyance was also administered to participants. Feedback on the field implementation of this survey and initial results concerning acoustic measurements, instantaneous annoyance ratings and questionnaire responses will be presented.

However, the limited availability of labeled data poses a significant challenge for supervised training. This article introduces a new method for classifying SAR data with minimal labeled images. The method is based on a feature extractor Vit trained with contrastive learning. It is trained on a dataset completely different from the one on which classification is made. The effectiveness of the method is assessed through 2D visualization using t SNE for qualitative evaluation and k NN classification with a small number of labeled data for quantitative evaluation. Notably, our results outperform a k NN on data processed with PCA and a ResNet 34 specifically trained for the task, achieving a 95.9 accuracy on the MSTAR dataset with just ten labeled images per class.

Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real space and time resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately 3 times 10 4 m s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid state analogs of quantum gravity.

Traditional experimental methods, such as the Planar Motion Mechanism PMM , are limited by the number of simultaneously articulated DOFs and are limited to single frequency testing, making such systems impractical for resolving frequency dependent added mass or damping matrices. The 6 DOF platform, termed a hexapod, overcomes these limitations by offering enhanced maneuverability and the ability to test broad banded frequency spectra in multiple degrees of freedom in a single experiment.

R B is a promising approach to increase the integrity of the software supply chain, when installing open source software built by third parties. Unfortunately, despite success stories like high build reproducibility levels in Debian packages, uncertainty remains among field experts on the scalability of R B to very large package repositories. In this work, we perform the first large scale study of bitwise reproducibility, in the context of the Nix functional package manager, rebuilding 709 816 packages from historical snapshots of the nixpkgs repository, the largest cross ecosystem open source software distribution, sampled in the period 2017 2023. We obtain very high bitwise reproducibility rates, between 69 and 91 with an upward trend, and even higher rebuildability rates, over 99 . We investigate unreproducibility causes, showing that about 15 of failures are due to embedded build dates. We release a novel dataset with all build statuses, logs, as well as full ''diffoscopes'' recursive diffs of where unreproducible build artifacts differ.

The main focus is on a version where users reserve a parking space when they take a car. In a first model, the reservation of parking spaces is effective for all users see 4 and capacity constraints are ignored. The model is carried out in thermodynamical limit, that is when the number N of stations and the number of cars M N tend to infinity, with U lim N to infty M N N . This limit is described by Kolmogorov equations of a two dimensional time inhomogeneous Markov process depicting the numbers of reservations and cars at a station. It satisfies a non linear differential system. We prove analytically that this system has a unique solution, which converges, as t to infty , to an equilibrium point exponentially fast. Moreover, this equilibrium point corresponds to the stationary distribution of a two queue tandem reservations, cars , which is here always ergodic. The intensity factor of each queue has an explicit form obtained from an intrinsic mass conservation relationship. Two related models with capacity constraints are briefly presented in the last section the simplest one with no reservation leads to a one dimensional problem the second one corresponds to our first model with finite total capacity K .

Motivated by recent works on hardware algorithmic co design towards efficient inference, we propose a compact binarized Conv3D LSTM model architecture called BILLNET, compatible with a highly resource constrained hardware. Firstly, BILLNET proposes to factorize the costly standard Conv3D by two pointwise convolutions with a grouped convolution in between. Secondly, BILLNET enables binarized weights and activations via a MUX OR gated residual architecture. Finally, to efficiently train BILLNET, we propose a multi stage training strategy enabling to fully quantize LSTM layers. Results on Jester dataset show that our method can obtain high accuracy with extremely low memory and computational budgets compared to existing Conv3D resource efficient models.

Adjusting sensor bias voltage and detection thresholds can help mitigate these effects, but generating simulated data that accurately mirror the performance evolution with the accumulation of luminosity, hence fluence, is crucial. The ATLAS collaboration has developed and implemented algorithms to correct simulated Monte Carlo MC events for radiation damage effects, achieving impressive agreement between collision data and simulated events. In preparation for the high luminosity phase HL LHC , the demand for a faster ATLAS MC production algorithm becomes imperative due to escalating collision, events, tracks, and particle hit rates, imposing stringent constraints on available computing resources. This article outlines the philosophy behind the new algorithm, its implementation strategy, and the essential components involved. The results from closure tests indicate that the events simulated using the new algorithm agree with fully simulated events at the level of few . The first tests on computing performance show that the new algorithm is as fast as it is when no radiation damage corrections are applied.

The More High resolution land cover mapping plays a crucial role in addressing a wide range of global challenges, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and sustainable development. However, creating accurate, large scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all weather, day and night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality.

They can impact the sediment continuity of the river and can create a sediment imbalance with zones of sediment accumulation upstream and a lack of sediment downstream from the dam. Upstream deposits are a major issue for managers as they can impact the operation and oraffect the safety of the structure and induce extra flood hazards. Operators therefore seek to determine the physical characteristics of these deposits to determine their remobilization potential.Usually, these sediment deposits are described using bathymetric data, sonar images or samples dredging, coring . For this study, new measurements from two geophysical methods acoustic and electromagnetic were used in addition to these current monitoring methods. The contribution of geophysical techniques is undeniable to improve the characterization of these deposits. These measurements make it possible to i define the internal structures of the sediments, ii determine the spatial distribution of these structures over the entire development, iii evaluate the volumes deposited when little bathymetric data is available on the reservoir. The coupling of these methods thus makes it possible to reconstruct the evolution and the structuring events of the sedimentary deposits. This approach provides complementary and important elements for managers in terms of exploitation and optimization of sedimentary deposits management scenarios.

Recently OpenAlex, a new open access bibliographic database, became available. We present OpenAlex2Pajek, an R package for converting OpenAlex data into a collection of Pajek's networks. For an illustration, we created a temporal weighted network describing the co authorship between world countries for years from 1990 to 2023. We present some analyses of this network.

Application to wastewater samples ANRS0160 Authors Alexandra Lefebvre, Vincent Mar chal, Arnaud Gloaguen, Ob pine Consortium, Amaury Lambert, Yvon Maday Abstract algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS CoV 2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations according to their probability of belonging to B.1.160, Alpha, Beta, B.1.177 variants with sel More Repeated waves of emerging variants during the SARS CoV 2 pandemics have highlighted the urge of collecting longitudinal genomic data and developing statistical methods based on time series analyses for detecting new threatening lineages and estimating their fitness early in time. Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages. Such process is prone to induce delays and bias. More recently, few authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most of the aforementioned methods are however either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS CoV 2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations according to their probability of belonging to B.1.160, Alpha, Beta, B.1.177 variants with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods which track specific mutations over time with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations.

Our tool is built upon a transformer based model 2 designed specifically to provide proof assistance in HOL4. The model is trained to discern theorem proving patterns from extensive libraries of HOL4 containing proofs of theorems. Consequently, it can accurately predict the next tactic s proof step s based on the history of previously employed tactics. The tool operates by reading a given sequence of tactics already used in a proof process in our case, it contains at least three tactics , referred to as the current proof state, and provides recommendations for the next optimal proof step s .
